# solar-lunar-analyse
A Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for exploring solar eclipse data from 2000 BCE to 3000 CE using a geospatial interface and filtered visualizations.

# About the Dataset
This dataset is provided by NASA, it shows detailed records of solar eclipses occurrences and predictions between the years -1999 and +3000 (2000 BCE to 3000 CE). It includes key parameters like eclipse type, magnitude, path width, geographic coordinates, and duration.

# Solar Eclipse Types
Partial Eclipse – Moon's penumbral shadow grazes Earth.
Annular Eclipse – Moon's antumbral shadow passes over Earth, leaving a visible ring.
Total Eclipse – Moon's umbral shadow covers the sun completely.
Hybrid Eclipse – Transition between annular and total eclipse, depending on location.
